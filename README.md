# Network-Analyzer
Jul 2023-Present         
Python project that captures Ethernet frames/IPv4 and ICMP packets on the user's network, and outputs their information in a GUI. This project is currently under construction, and I intend add anomaly detection and alerts for suspicious activity on the network.
