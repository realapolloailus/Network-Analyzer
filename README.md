# Network-Analyzer
Jul 2023-Present         
Python project that captures Ethernet frames/IPv4 and ICMP packets on the user's network, and outputs their information in a GUI. This project is currently under construction, and I intend add anomaly detection and alerts for suspicious activity on the network.
To use:

1. Clone the repository locally.
2. Open a terminal in the directory where the repository has been cloned.
3. Run gui.py, which is located in the src folder.
4. While the program is running in the terminal, press Ctrl+C to pause the terminal output and open the GUI, which will display the same information in a window with start/stop buttons. This GUI is a work-in-progress, and the need to press Ctrl+C will be removed in a future commit.
